# Incorporating in Washington and Oregon

These notes are only partially organized. Questions are welcome.


## Naming

Here are some name suggestions. Unless I made a note, I don't know
what names are available.

- Festival Support Services, LLC
- Festival Training Services, LLC
- Festival Safety, LLC

For flexibility, I"m thinking the LLC name would be more generic and
we'd use DBAs for Safety Northwest or other future projects. (Could
we run CLC or a Burn After Meeting style conference as DBAs? Sure we
could, if we found people to lead those teams. Then, the LLC might
step back into the Planning/Logistics/Fin/Admin roles.)
