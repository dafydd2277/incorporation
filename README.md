# Incorporating in Washington and Oregon

These notes are only partially organized. Questions are welcome.


## Naming

Here are some name suggestions. Unless I made a note, I don't know
what names are available.

- Festival Support Services, LLC
- Festival Training Services, LLC
- Festival Safety, LLC

For flexibility, I"m thinking the LLC name would be more generic and
we'd use DBAs for Safety Northwest or other future projects. (Could
we run CLC or a Burn After Meeting style conference as DBAs? Sure we
could, if we found people to lead those teams. Then, the LLC might
step back into the Planning/Logistics/Fin/Admin roles.)

### Get a Business License

- Maybe? Maybe not. Can use the Business License to get a DBA.
    - "Festval Support, LLC, DBA Safety Northwest 2025."
        That leads doing limited-time corporations/licenses for each
        event. That has advantages in disadvantages.
  - [Business License][241124m] and adding a d/b/a "Safety
  Northwest," or d/b/a "Cascadia Leadership Conference."

 ### S-Corporations

- The key point I'm reading here is that members of the S-Corp are
still taxed as individuals. I/we still need to research the
implications of tasing the LLC/Corp as its own entity.

### C-Corporations
C-Corporations are taxed as their own entity, where S-Corps have the
taxes passed through to the individual members.

 - [Wikipedia link][241127e]

    
### Tax Code Exemptions


501(c)3, etc. Right now, I think this is too much to bite off at the
start.
