# Questions for the visit with SCORE
###### 2024-11-27, 1400 PST

- First, I want to say this is deep background. I'll present to the
other two people who are doing this with me and we'll make our
decisions next week or the week after.


- We're considering WA and OR to register. I'm in WA so I'm picking
up that information, but OR is a valid choice as well.
    - For my part, I'm indifferent aside from being the one who digs
    doing this kind of research.

- Mostly what I'm looking for from This visit with SCORE is an idea of
the pitfalls I need to look out for.

- We need to have a solution for an event the end of April, 2025.
However, I'm ambitions about this and already considering 2026 and
later and expanding into producing other events.

- (Background on what we're setting up.)





    ## Questions

- 2025 vs. the future. What do we do for this year. What do we do
this year that makes 2026 and on easier to manage?

- S-Corp vs. C-Corp? That decision will probably be heavily
influenced by the next point:

- Individual Registration vs multi-member LLC?
    - State considerations
    - IRS considerations



- LLCs, Business Licenses, DBAs and "nesting corporations?
    - Create LLC with a DBA of "SafetyNorthwest 2025? Give that DBA an
    end date?
    - How deep to get without getting "lost in the weeds."
       


- I've only barely started on Articles of Incorporation or the
equialent declarations. That's probably a huge area.
    - And it will be a factor in the overall setup of the corporate
    structure, especially if we want room in the future to expand
    what we do.
